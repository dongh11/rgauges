rgauges 0.2.0
===============

NEW FEATURES 

* Changed from CC0 to MIT license. 
* All functions gain parameter `key` so that you can pass in a key directly instead of passing in a key name which looks for a key in your options settings or in your .Rprofile
* Added a vignette (#8)

BUG FIXES

* Fixed cofiguration of api key in the header using `add_headers` rather than `list(httpheader=...)` - works with new version of `httr`
