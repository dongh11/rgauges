# `rgauges`

`rgauges` is a set of functions to retrieve and post (GET and POST) data via the Gaug.es API.  I basically just run API calls in R through the command line (using system() function), as it doesn't appear simple to do calls using the RCurl package, e.g.

See the Gaug.es API documentation here: http://get.gaug.es/documentation/

Get your own API in your Gaug.es 'My Account' page and put in your .Rprofile file under the name 'GaugesKey'.

Functions still in development...
